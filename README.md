# elevators

This app has an 8 stories building and 2 elevators.  
An elevator could be in moving state or in waiting state (elevator waits for 2 seconds after reaching its destination floor).  
Each floor has an up/ down buttons which can call an elevator.
The elevator that would be assigned to that floor is the closest one which isn't currently moving and isn't currently on waiting state.  
Between the calling button there is a timer that counts down in half-seconds and shows the time until the arrival of the elevator.
